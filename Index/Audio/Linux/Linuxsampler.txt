{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
I haven't looked into pipewire before. But from what I see (not verified) they 
solved it like this: JACK client apps are supposed to link against the 
pipewire version of the JACK client lib (i.e. /usr/lib/pipewire-0.3/jack/
libjack.so.0) instead of the official JACK client lib (i.e. /usr/lib/
libjack.so.0).

And yes, pipewire-jack-dropin apparently is intended to make this working for 
existing JACK clients as well without recompiling them, by installing a config 
file to /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ which in turn would override/remap the linker path 
to the JACK client lib.

But your other apps are apparently not using that ld.so.conf.d mechanism which 
ldd output proofs. They are directly linked to pipewire's lib instead. So 
chances are that something with your pipewire-jack-dropin is incorrect. It may 
be a path has simply changed for instance (e.g. there is pipewire version 
number in the path).

So you either figure out what's wrong with the ld.so.conf.d file, or you 
recompile LS and replace in configure.ac the line

	PKG_CHECK_MODULES(JACK, jack, have_jack=1, have_jack=0)

to search and link against pipewire's lib directly at compile time instead.

You might also check what other audio apps are doing at compile time. Probably 
they already changed their configure script to search for both, the official 
JACK and pipewire's JACK and pick automatically either one available at 
compile time.

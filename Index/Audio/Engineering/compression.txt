====== compression ======
Created Monday 04 July 2022

The SC1 Compressor has three main buttons: "Threshold level (dB)", "Ratio (1:n)" and "Makeup gain (dB)". The "Threshold level" sets the Level at which Compressor will compress or squeeze the sound. The "Ratio" controls how much it will squeeze when it reaches the Threshold. The "Makeup gain" boosts the whole signal after the Compression occurs. To soften out a vocal, you could set a "Threshold level" of −10dB or so and a "Ratio" of 2.5, and then bring the volume back up with the "Makeup gain".

For soft vocal Compression, you would want a semi-fast "Attack time" so that the Compressor catches the beginning of each word, a slower "Release time" to let the voice ring out, and a soft "Knee radius" to create a gentle form of compression that isn't too noticeable. If you want to make drums sound big, you might try a slow "Attack time" so that you don't Compress the pop of the drum, a fast "Release time" so that the Compressor can catch the next hit of the drum, and a large "Ratio" to make the Dynamics between the beginning and end of the drum hit similar.

start by trying to describe what "depression" or the lack of desire to do anything....
ted talk quote "every movement...etc"

if you've never felt this way...then you might have a hard time understanding. Without a visual confirmation, it may appear to be nothing. 

if you've had life expierences that make you think all the things required from other people aren't that important...the disatisfaction needs to be filled in. current society does not offer much besides consumer activity to compensate. if you aren't able to afford shopping, then medication and probably a few nights at a dingy jail cell relabeled as a hosiptal will be part of your life story. and of course since you aren't doing the same thing as everyone else, you will probably feel shamed at least several times which usually doesn't motivate productive action. etc 

so not only is there dealing with the physical nature of a "mental illness", which is like having a slightly fractured foot without a cast for your entire life, and during that time you are demanded to run in seemingly endless marathon and if you dont...you may not get eat or know where you'll sleep. if you happen to become upset with this at one point and get naturally lost in frustrated rage, you get added bonus as being labeled an abusive, toxic person who won't accept help...and that you should be avoided if noticed.

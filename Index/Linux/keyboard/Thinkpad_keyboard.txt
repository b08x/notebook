If you have set a different keyboard layout, you will notice that your nice, new graphical login prompt does not use it. This is because the X window system uses its own configuration files. We need to tell it which layout to use.

Change to a command prompt by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1 and login.
Change the layout, e.g. in my case to Norwegian Dvorak by running
sudo localectl --no-convert set-x11-keymap no thinkpad dvorak
In general, the format is
sudo localectl --no-convert set-x11-keymap <layout> [<keyboard_model> [<keyboard_variant>]]
where <keyboard_model> is optional, but has to be provided if <keyboard_variant> is wanted to be provided.
I think the keymap model thinkpad is the right one, but I do not know for certain. A list of keyboard models can be gotten by running
localectl list-x11-keymap-models
A list of layouts can be gotten by running
localectl list-x11-keymap-layouts
A list of variants can be gotten by running
localectl list-x11-keymap-variants <layout>
where <layout> is the layout you want the variants of.
Reboot by running
reboot
The layout should now work.

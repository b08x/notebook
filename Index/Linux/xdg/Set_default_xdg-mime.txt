====== xdg-mime ======
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
$ xdg-mime query default inode/directory
exfalso.desktop
I determined that Ex Falso was (at least) the per-user default file browser. In fact,

$ xdg-open ~
was lauching Ex Falso on my home directory. I therefore executed

$ xdg-mime default nautilus.desktop inode/directory
$ xdg-mime query default inode/directory
nautilus.desktop
$ xdg-open ~
and now my per-user setting was corrected. But still not the system wide one.

I noticed that ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list had a new line

[Default Applications]
 inode/directory=nautilus.desktop;
Although the file /usr/share/applications/mimeapps.list does not exist, /usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache does and had the line

[Default Applications]
 inode/directory=exfalso.desktop;nautilus.desktop;
that I changed to

[Default Applications]
 inode/directory=nautilus.desktop;
I deleted the corresponding one from ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list and now the problem is solved, my common sense system wide configuration is correct. And yet I don't know from where it came.

UPDATE: updating the system may launch update-desktop-database (from the desktop-file-utils package) and revert the changes made in /usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache. A workaround is to delete the mimetype field of /usr/share/applications/exfalso.desktop.

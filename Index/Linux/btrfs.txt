Created Monday 27 September 2021

==== Creating lightweight copies ====
	   By default, when copying files on a Btrfs filesystem with cp, actual copies are created. To create a lightweight copy referencing to the original data, use the reflink option:

		 $ cp --reflink *source* *dest*

	 If you use --reflink=always on a non-COW capable filesystem, you will be given an error.

==== Corruption recovery ====
	   btrfs-check cannot be used on a mounted file system. To be able to use btrfs-check without booting from a live USB, add it to the initial ramdisk:

		/etc/mkinitcpio.conf  BINARIES=("/usr/bin/btrfs")

	   Regenerate the initramfs.

	   Then if there is a problem booting, the utility is available for repair.

	   Note:  If  the  fsck process has to invalidate the space cache (and/or other caches?) then it is normal for a subsequent boot to hang up for a while (it may give console messages
	   about btrfs-transaction being hung). The system should recover from this after a while.

==== Booting into snapshots ====
	   In order to boot into a snapshot you must specify the subvolume via a kernel parameter using rootflags=subvol=/path/to/subvolume and alter your /etc/fstab to point  to  the  same
	   subvolume  using  subvol=.  Alternatively  the subvolume can be specified with its id - retrievable with e.g. btrfs subvolume list /root/path - and rootflags=subvolid=objectid as
	   kernel parameter respectively subvolid=objectid as mount option in /etc/fstab.

	   If using GRUB you can automatically populate your boot menu with btrfs snapshots when regenerating the configuration file with the help of grub-btrfs or grub-btrfs-git.

==== The snapshot you are trying to boot into is probably set as read-only. ====

You can check it with:

$ sudo btrfs property get -ts /path/to/snapshot/
If it returns ro=true, you have to make it writable with:

$ sudo btrfs property set -ts /path/to/snapshot/ ro false

=== To apply compression to existing files ===

use the btrfs filesystem defragment -calg command, where alg is either zlib, lzo or zstd. For example, in order to re-compress the whole file system with zstd, run the following command:

# btrfs filesystem defragment -r -v -czstd /

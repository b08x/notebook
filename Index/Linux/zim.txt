Gtk+ has it's own config file that allows you to customize how things look. This is the gtkrc file and it is typically saved as ~/.gtkrc-2.0 in the home directory. Some widgets have a name so you can set specific options for those widgets. Widgets that have a name in zim are:

The textview showing the page: zim-pageview
The treeview showing the page index: zim-pageindex
You can for example set the font used in the index by adding this to your gtkrc file:

{{{code: lang="ruby" linenumbers="False"
style "zim-pageindex-style"
{
	font_name = "Sans 8"
}
widget "*.zim-pageindex" style "zim-pageindex-style"
}}}


or this example to make the treeview a bit more compact:
{{{code: lang="ruby" linenumbers="False"
style "gtkcompact" 
{
	GtkTreeView::vertical-separator=0
	GtkTreeView::horizontal-separator=0
	GtkTreeView::expander-size=6
	GtkTreeView::fixed-height-mode=TRUE
	GtkWidget::focus_padding=0
}
class "GtkWidget" style "gtkcompact"
}}}


To change the base colors of the pageview widget use something like:
{{{code: lang="ruby" linenumbers="False"
style "mycolors" 
{
	base[NORMAL]: "black"
	base[SELECTED]: "#6699cc"
	text[NORMAL]: "#c0c0c0"
}
widget "*.zim-pageview" style "mycolors"
}}}

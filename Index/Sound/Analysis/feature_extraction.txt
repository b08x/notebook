====== feature extraction ======


Broadly speaking, it filters out the very low-frequency temporal components (below 1Hz) which are often due to a changing auditory environment or microphone. High frequency temporal components, above 13Hz, are also removed since they represent changes that are faster than the speech articulators can move

===== spectral centroid =====
High values indicates moments in the music where most of the sound energy is on the high-frequency register, whereas low values indicates moments where most of the sound energy is on the low-frequency register.

===== window size =====
Windows must be long enough to capture relevant information, but not so long that they lose temporal resolution;

We therefore focus on two window sizes: 2048 samples, which captures the local content of the signal, and 16,384 samples,
which is sufficient to capture almost all relevant context

512 step size

Try an odd number windows size. f.e: WINDOWSIZE=1025 

M=2047, N=2048,

==== try slowing down a sample that contains a lot of fast information ====

Turetsky & Ellis (2003) propose cutoffs in the 2.5kHz range
The fundamental frequencies of many notes in MusicNet are higher than the 50 × 22.5Hz ≈ 1kHz
cutoff. Nevertheless, we find that all notes align well using only the low-frequency information.


22,050Hz is theNyquist frequency of a signal sampled at 44.1kHz

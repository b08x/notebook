==== causes ====
* world hunger/poverty
* malnutrition/bad diet
* default mode thinking...influenced by adverts (see quote from 'minimalism')
* labels, judgement, stigma - bad language
	* mainstream media mostly reporting only the crimes committed during a crisis, rarely provides a complete context...
* "how much does it cost to live?
	* How much does it cost to die?
* "society" - racism, police bruality/indifference
* stigma around the concept of "addiction"
	* the addictions to consumerism are not considered the same, as the consequences are often at the expense of under-represented portions of population. gap shirts are ok to buy because you can't see the 12 year old making them for 16 hours a day. 
	* medication often times comes with negative consequences, medication is experimental. e.g. not much is actually known about the lasting effects of Amphertimes (Adderall) and the medical is rarely held accountable for this....
	* side effects include increased negative pyschosis events...for example, personally, without a manual, amphetimens lead to out of control rage states which included domestic violence and sexual assault. previous to being given medication, the worst part was feeling terrible

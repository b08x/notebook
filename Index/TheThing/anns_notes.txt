==== causes ====
* world hunger/poverty
* malnutrition/bad diet
* default mode thinking...influenced by adverts (see quote from 'minimalism')
* labels, judgement, stigma - bad language
	* mainstream media mostly reporting only the crimes committed during a crisis, rarely provides a complete context...
* "how much does it cost to live?
	* How much does it cost to die?
* "society" - racism, police bruality/indifference
* stigma around the concept of "addiction"
	* the addictions to consumerism are not considered the same, as the consequences are often at the expense of under-represented portions of population. gap shirts are ok to buy because you can't see the 12 year old making them for 16 hours a day. 
	* medication often times comes with negative consequences, medication is experimental. e.g. not much is actually known about the lasting effects of Amphertimes (Adderall) and the medical is rarely held accountable for this....
	* side effects include increased negative pyschosis events...for example, personally, without a manual, amphetimens lead to out of control rage states which included domestic violence and sexual assault. previous to being given medication, the worst part was just feeling dysphoric and mildy frustrated. while the medication has made life better in many ways, it also at times has made life much worse. The patient is often the only one held responsible by means of; restraints, judgement given with shaming, doctors often hide their ignorance behind their jargon and use that in reports that are always missing a great of deal of context so further treatment is often hindered as doctors trust each other and trust the patient very little. patients are often demeaned, treated rudely, flat out ignored. These days still, pyschiactrict wings of most hospitals are merely holding pens for people that apparently don't deserve things like: going outside, a decent paint job, computers and various subtle things that are important to a healthy live that simply are not provided. 

* judgement for asking help
* * not knowing what to ask for: when the language fails, and the patient cannot commuincate what is really going on in their mind, that frustration builds until eventually an explosion of emotion occurs. This pushes the patitent further away from the goal. it seems to be that because the patient cannot describe what the root problem is, that they need to be treated like children and not taken seriously. 
* organized religion

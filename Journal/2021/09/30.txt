A holophorum is conducted by a soundbot to create a holonythm. A soundbot can be directed by another person in real time, or pre-programmed with a set of variables that it will use to generate logical, emotionally pleasing sound and a simulated visual expereince that will arouse the senses. Exactly like a live band, except once left alone by the operator it's not going to sexually harass you because it knows it can.  


A holophorum is a session involving a band, a group, or a rape of musicians. (in this case a rape means a group of musicians who also are fluent bash programmers)



A soundbot, is a node comprising of software and hardware, functioning harmoniously. A soundbot naturally requires robot stuff to function.

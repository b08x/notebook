I think what will stop the teacher/student relationship would be some acknowledgement for what I'm trying to accomplish. I don't know what that looks like exactly and not to seem cold but so far its  only your work that attention. Not that you have in the future, but you never really asked about my work. It's a social skill...you don't need specific  knowledge to participate. What really bothers me is that people want me to talk about my problems, well I had to learn the words first and those words weren't around during my formative years. Now...I'm done venting...you really don't have to do anything now. 


ok, i'd like to leave you alone now as I so much to process I keep doing the thing you want me to stop. but without reassurances of the future, I cannot stop. also life and death as prolonged episodes like this often lead to suicide. Which isn't something you can see on a scan, which makes my job just a little bit more in need of support and now I have to tell myself that I'm so good at it, that I don't feel a sense of importance. As you can tel 

Don't make me use fear to get out this. As soon I won't be able to control my anger from being ignored.

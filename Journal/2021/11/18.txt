I think what will stop the teacher/student relationship would be some acknowledgement for what I'm trying to accomplish. I don't know what that looks like exactly and not to seem cold but so far its  only your work that attention. Not that you have in the future, but you never really asked about my work. It's a social skill...you don't need specific  knowledge to participate. What really bothers me is that people want me to talk about my problems, well I had to learn the words first and those words weren't around during my formative years. Now...I'm done venting...you really don't have to do anything now.

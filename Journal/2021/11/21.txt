I've been trying
not to use so much humor to avoid things I don't like,
which is more of a challenge than I would've thought.
I have say it is easier to do alone. I'm sorry I tried to rush your
process because I couldn't understand this and sort of refused to.
I made myself stubborn to defend against the rest of the world. It
was never meant to be used against you. Which is just something I 
want known not dwelled upon. 

Feeling relieved.

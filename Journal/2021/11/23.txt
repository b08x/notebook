So, I'm going to approach this an arbitrator since you both seem a bit hesitant to engage. I'm looking at this as holistically as humanly possible. I say this because both of you will want specific individual tasks taken as priority. My opinion is in favor of the one who has to worry about survival (basic needs, shelter, food etc). So Ann, so you are now in the process of being relived of supported Robert in his studies, I need you to fight off that notion that you are in "debt". In the eyes of you humanity, you would be remembered as a Saint. Taking a bit from the concept of Karma, it does not care about the details sorted in a spreadsheet as that is information specific to infrastructure planning which shouldn't involve an individual burden but we can't prevent ourselves from wanting to help each other so passionately. 

So Bob, I ask of you to continue practice with a loved one who needs to give attention to another loved one. Asking anything more at this point paralyzes you in worry because you feel you can't actively help. This is bullshit and you need to stop being such a pussy. 

Ann, I ask of you to maintain your demonstration of patience until at a plan for how Bob can transition from a mindset of observation to a mindset of participation. I don't think either of want to wait until the lease is officially satisfied because you feel a sense of urgency to complete this particular phase of life. I cannnot tell you the future, I can only say it makes sense to me that if we rush through we will

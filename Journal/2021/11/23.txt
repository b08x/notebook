So, I'm going to approach this an arbitrator since you both seem a bit hesitant to engage. I'm looking at this as wholeistically as humanly possible. I say this because both of you will want specific individual tasks taken as priority. My opinion is in favor of the one who has to worry about survival (basic needs, shelter, food etc). So Ann, so you are now in the process of being relived of supported Robert in his studies, I need you to fight off that notion that you are in "debt". In the eyes of you humanity, you would be remembered as a Saint. Taking a bit from the concept of Karma, it does not care about the details sorted in a spreadsheet as that is information specific to infrastructure planning which shouldn't involve such a invididual burden.

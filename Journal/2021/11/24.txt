Ok. The only motivation I have now is show you the same compassion and patience you gave me when I was being unreasonable. 
You need to somehow find the courage to just call and say hello. After now seeing you act no better than I could when controlled with fear, I want out of your life and you out of mine before things get worse. The difference between us here is that my confronting you on your controlling behavior puts my life in literal jeopardy. All you have to do to finish the misery that is my life is to assert your power with money. You know this and feel justified in what you are currently doing. The exact thing you say you are afraid of me for. Isn't it odd how it can look so different?

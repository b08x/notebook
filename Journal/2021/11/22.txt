So without another familiar person around,  confidence is at around 50% less than when consistently around one. This is how regret starts to consume. All the decisions get called into question. The trouble is, when the person actively seeks the companionship, instinct tells the other the seeker is weak and needy and not to be accepted. That's the theory anyway. Being desperate and lonely is embarrassing way to make friends. How often do you find yourself willing to try new things when you feel desperate and embarrassed?  This is what the idea of a family is suppose to help alleviate. They're suppose to  be sort of a safety net so we don't lose our minds. The concept of a universal family, while ideal to me, seems another lifetime away. General extremism that our current culture fosters prevents this from believable consideration. This hostile mindset was amplified  through the advent of "instant communication" and the gratification that comes from the information technology field in general. We both choose material "the computer" to put it simply as our most important asset. Neither of us chose each other.  You're choosing what you need, because you can now. But you look down on me for not being able to do the same. Which is funny, because I technically can't think of one reason why you need me or why you agreed to enter this relationship in the first place.  I like to think I contribute something besides a good taste in music. Or were you able to somehow focus better because you had more pleasurable sounds around you. Probably not but it's better than feeling worthless.  This is the first time in your life you've had this kind of stability. You're job one of  I'm going along  This is the opinion of someone currently dealing with loss, acceptance, confusion, a sense of betrayal...etc etc . I'm certain you remember exactly what this feels like from your experience with Lisa. Right now I am you, and you are Lisa. Sort of. In the sense I am the "heartbroken" one and you are relieved from someone you can't understand.

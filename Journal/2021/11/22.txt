Well, ok..I've been afraid to share this but I'll try anyway; I've been trying this time to realistically, not manically, asses our problems and pick only one to focus on. So far, at least from my point of view, I think we try to do too much at once and then quickly feel defeat because it becomes overwhelming. I know I said in anger that I "refuse to get a job because blah blah blah". This isn't really true. When I thinking about that process it gives me anxiety so then I stop thinking about it. Also, for some reason anything I think of produces no true enthusiasm for the task, which I don't actually understand. I feel comfortable at least trying something to get extra income so we can acquire a better space. I might even be ok with "merchant Bob" if I can work for someone like-minded. Ideally, I'd like to try offering my services to Riverside however I hesitate as my body clock is not in sync with business hours and I don't know how to handle that yet. My Soundbot project isn't turning out to be what I had in mind initially ( I was hoping to gain attention with the product and somehow turn that into income ) so I think I give up on that as I've also lost sight of what is truly important.

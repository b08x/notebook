Well, ok..I've been afraid to share this but I'll try anyway; I've been trying this time to realistically, not manically, assess our problems and pick only one to focus on. I think we try to do too much at once and then quickly feel defeat because it becomes overwhelming. I know I said in anger that I "refuse to get a job because blah blah blah". This isn't really true. When I start thinking about that process it truly gives me anxiety so then I stop thinking about it. Also, for some reason anything I think of produces no true enthusiasm, which I don't actually understand because I should be motivated by love. I feel comfortable at least trying something to get extra income so we can acquire a better space or pay debt. I might be comfortable with "merchant Bob" if I can work for someone like-minded. Ideally, I'd like to try offering my services to Riverside however I hesitate as my body clock is not in sync with business hours and I don't know how to handle that yet. My Soundbot project isn't turning out to be what I had in mind. I was hoping to gain attention with the "product" and somehow turn that into income but I'm not organized enough for that. So, I need give up on that as I've also lost sight of what you need...which is less stress about money. You're right, I didn't really address these things you have asked for. I was caught up in self-righteousness and unrealistic goals, which I only know now in hindsight. And while I have the right mindset, I'm not sure what to do about making all of this less intimidating. I'm trying to maintain the attitude that this is easier than I think, which is a challenge for me. Regardless of how we figure this out, I feel exactly the same in that our routine is in need of adjustment. Somehow, we are now afraid to say anything  Anyway, for right now, stayed rested...keep your thoughts focused on Cheryl as I can't stand the thought of being another worry in your life. Love you.

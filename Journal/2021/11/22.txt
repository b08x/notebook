Well, ok..I've been afraid to share this but I'll try anyway; I've been trying this time to realistically, not manically, assess our problems and pick only one to focus on. I think we try to do too much at once and then quickly feel defeat because it becomes overwhelming. I know I said in anger that I "refuse to get a job because blah blah blah". This isn't really true. When I start thinking about that process it truly gives me anxiety so then I stop thinking about it. Also, for some reason anything I think of produces no true enthusiasm for the task, which I don't actually understand. I feel comfortable at least trying something to get extra income so we can acquire a better space. I might even be comfortable with "merchant Bob" if I can work for someone like-minded. Ideally, I'd like to try offering my services to Riverside however I hesitate as my body clock is not in sync with business hours and I don't know how to handle that yet. My Soundbot project isn't turning out to be what I had in mind (I was hoping to gain attention with the product and somehow turn that into income but I'm not organized enough for that) so I need give up on that as I've also lost sight of what you need...which is less stress about money. You're right, I didn't really address these things you have asked for. I was caught up in self-righteousness and pride, which I only know now after accumulation. And while I have the right mindset, I'm not sure what to do about making all of this less intimidating.

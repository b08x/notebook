Well, ok..I've been afraid to share this but I'll try anyway; I've been trying this time to realistically, not manically, assess our problems and pick only one to focus on. I think we try to do too much at once and then quickly feel defeat because it becomes overwhelming. I know I said in anger that I "refuse to get a job because blah blah blah". This isn't really true. When I start thinking about that process it truly gives me anxiety so then I stop thinking about it. Also, for some reason anything I think of produces no true enthusiasm, which I don't actually understand because I should be motivated by love. I feel comfortable at least trying something to get extra income so we can acquire a better space or pay debt. I might be comfortable with "merchant Bob" if I can work for someone like-minded. Ideally, I'd like to try offering my services to Riverside however I hesitate as my body clock is not in sync with business hours and I don't know how to handle that yet. My Soundbot project isn't turning out to be what I had in mind. I was hoping to gain attention with the "product" and somehow turn that into income but I'm not organized enough for that. So, I need give up on that as I've also lost sight of what you need...which is less stress about money. You're right, I didn't really address these things you have asked for. I was caught up in self-righteousness and unrealistic goals, which I only know now in hindsight. And while I have the right mindset, I'm not sure what to do about making all of this less intimidating. I'm trying to maintain the attitude that this is easier than I think, which is a challenge for me. Regardless of how we figure this out, I feel exactly the same in that our routine is in need of adjustment. Somehow, we are now afraid to say anything to each other. Anyway, for right now, stayed rested...keep your thoughts focused on Cheryl as I can't stand the thought of being another worry in your life. Love you.


It seems my biggest problem to address first, is that I don't know anything about the process of handling this type situation through separation. Like, what do you do to remind yourself 

I feel sad we ended up afraid of talking to each other about these truly difficult problems. I yelled out of frustration, which made you afraid, then you became silent which made me afraid and now we don't want to say anything because we're not sure how the other will react. I'm sad because, if we can just acknowledge this together, then a lot of our problems start becoming less complicated. I hope I'm just overthinking this. I just don't want this break for us to calm down to result in falling back into the same routine that got us into this. 


I think I've finally been able to accept your need to be away from our situation without taking it personally. So, if thinking about all this still upsets, then please stop and feel safe in the notion that I understand and no longer hold anger nor resentment. No more threats. I'm sorry I was unable to communicate my frustration with less harmful words, I really didn't know how. I know you feel sorry as well and lack satisfaction with the relationship. I worry if we don't figure out how to deal with our fear and the resulting conflict, that these problems will never go away regardless of who we are sharing life with. I really wish we had another pair of people to be friends with..but that's a whole another challenge in itself. I think we both became too focused on self-improvement, never realizing relationship-improvement requires a different type of work. Neither one of us could have possibly known this.

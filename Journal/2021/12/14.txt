So we will "lie" when we are asked questions that require a lot of brain 
e.g. "hey, turn the music down, I have a headache". Translates roughly into a 13,000 page novella about a very adorable anxiety disorder...

I don't really care to write about this sort of thing. I'm happy I was able to tell Ann how I "feel" about her and with that she was quite flattered. I saw her shyness  She also looked quite relieved when I was able to show her that I understand our problem. She doesn't have as frequent a mood swing. She always forgets to use the phrase "right now" when she says she doesn't want contact. What an idiot. 

I think we finally understand each other. She does switch between types of Ann. I just assumed she could switch it up on demand. Having only recently learned how to manage my mood swings, I could never relate to this when it came to physical relations.

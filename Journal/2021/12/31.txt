Hello. I hope this letter finds you doing well. I would like to introduce myself but depending on what you're looking for, who I am depends on how you identify the self in company of others. Or least I tell myself that so I can seem pragmatic and mysterious. What my resume may not reflect are mostly object oriented antics and activities more focused on the home. As a person, when I'm not trying to confuse myself with words, I do my best to love my partner along with the subtleties of life. As an Open Source enthusiast and a relative minimalist, I believe I can contribute a great deal to the NextGen environment. I was lucky enough to have absorbed the concept of "Unix philosophy" which emphasizes building simple, short, clear, modular, and extensible applications that can be maintained by anyone who is familiar with the language. I think this practice balances well with my experience doing direct technical support which focused more on guiding folks through client applications as opposed to working with developer folks, helping to optimize the infrastructure as well as providing the necessary tools to build with.

I'll leave the rest up to your imagination.

- Bob

====== Monday 13 Dec 2021 ======

I need help organizing these objects. I'm not sure if I should arrange things to pack or to use for living. I don't want Ann to have to be subjected the noise here, so I don't think it's a good idea to arrange furniture such that she is thought to be living with me. 

More my sister...whom I find sexually attractive and therefore difficult to be around. 

My Friend...who I'd like to be my girlfriend, but with my expierence I find the idea of a romantic pursuit to be too much for me right now.

wife|partner with whom I am currently separted from...
	which leads to a conclusion/revelation that she 
		a: currently is romantically involved with someone else now
		b: was romantically involved with someone else at some point in the past


I've never accepted the roles that don't include physical contact that leads to sexual activities.

I suppose I could if I could keep a certain perspective in mind..






















If you had to //promise// me that we'd talk today, that tells me is something isn't right. I'm hoping you were just being reassuring, knowing that I have anxiety issues and being alone with is tough. Recently you haven't been able to keep promises and now the trust I have in you is dwindling much like the trust you had in me must have been broken.

I don't want to make another promise that will end up unfullfilled. Our lack of being able to comfortably express Physical affection is the only thing that really is preventing my ability to keep the promises I that made with you. It's really about self-esteem and confidence. To hopefully continue the process of mending trust I would like for you to tell me what would wanted most from me. If you are still willing to fix our relationship, then I can start plannning on how get what it is you want.

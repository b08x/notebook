I had to smoke a lot of cigarettes to get into this. Depending on what you're looking for, who I am depends on how you identify the self in company of others. Or least I tell myself that so I seem more pragmatic yet mysterious. What my work experience may not include are mostly object oriented antics and various other things that I would have to make up to remember. As a person, I find the continued sensation of a three dimensional space to be most important. When I'm not trying to confuse myself with words I do my best to love my partner who is also a therapist to people who need technical support.

I had to smoke a lot of cigarettes to get into this. Depending on what you're looking to get from a person, who I am depends on how you identify with the self when in the company of others. Or least I tell myself that so I seem pragmatic. What my work experience may not include are mostly object oriented antics. When I'm not trying to confuse myself with words I do my best to support my partner. As person, I find oxygen to be the most important aspect of my life as well as the continued sensation of a three dimensional space.

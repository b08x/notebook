Midnight. The clock moves ahead. I injest 15 additional milligrams. 

06:00am. The eyes don't want to stay shut. So I'm hoping 30mg will perk me up long enough to feel some sort of satisfaction...

It's not to say that I'm not satisfied, but the eyes are not.

2:00pm 30mg
good boost, doesn't last longer than a few hours...:/

I have a lot to do. I try to tell myself to look forward to a break to regenerate. I can't rest yet. 

7:42 30 mg

I had to smoke a lot of cigarettes to get into this. Depending on what you're looking for, who I am depends on how you identify the self in company of others. Or least I tell myself that so I seem more pragmatic yet mysterious. What my work experience may not include are mostly object oriented antics and various other things that I would have to make up to remember. As a person, I find the continued sensation of a three dimensional space to be most important. When I'm not trying to confuse myself with words I do my best to love my partner who is also a therapist to people who need technical support.

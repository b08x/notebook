Midnight. The clock moves ahead. I injest 15 additional milligrams. 

06:00am. The eyes don't want to stay shut. So I'm hoping 30mg will perk me up long enough to feel some sort of satisfaction...

It's not to say that I'm not satisfied, but the eyes are not.

2:00pm 30mg
good boost, doesn't last longer than a few hours...:/

I have a lot to do. I try to tell myself to look forward to a break to regenerate. I can't rest yet.

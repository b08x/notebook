One thing that helped me was turning delusions into stories. The fact that you are aware of your delusions and can tell the difference tells me you'll have success with this. A telepathic prophet who has a relationship with someone, could make for a great science-fiction story. Think of your delusions as pitches for these stories. For example, the pitch of a telepathic prophet, would be something to pass on...but the next one you might have...for example one delusion I had was that I was a captain of a team who was trapped by an enemy in a psychological nightmare called "life" that I had to figure a way out of. This is one, you would pass on, but given my personal experiences, I would turn this into a full-length story. It helps to think of authors who write fantasy. Game of Thrones, American Gods, come to mind, are stories built upon "delusional" or "fantasy" thinking. These, I believe, actually helps u In terms of preparing, exercises in this will be invaluable. Another crucial aspect will be for you find like minded people that you can be in a safe environment with. While a lot of us are forced to go through this alone, it is not the ideal to go.

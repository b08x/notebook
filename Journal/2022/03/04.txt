In addition to a borderline obsession with optimizing systems and applications, I take great personal interest in experimenting with sound to alleviate aspects of the human condition we all experience. The potential I see in Calm as a long term reliable source for this type of information, is the ability to organize and translate widely scattered bits of challenging data into an enjoyable user experience. While I have not demoed the app, I do appreciate the content and usability of the website. I was pretty happy to see a Stephen Fry expert I haven't heard before, so thank you.  

I believe once compression and subjective loudness issues are fully worked out and optimized, soundscapes with positive messages will enhance the life experience in many profound ways beyond what we aim for today. As the scope of "mindfulness metadata" has yet to be fully realized, I would quite enjoy the opportunity to participate and assist in this endeavor where needed. The requirements of learning (internal tools) as well as advocating for users in distress, are core functions I incorporate in my daily life regardless, so I think this position could be a good fit.

I must admit, I am quite terrible at debugging issues while I sleep. Despite my best efforts, different therapies, pills, fad diets, you name it...without fail, every time I attempt sleep, my brain will paralyze me while it takes me through the array of bizarre scenarios we go through during the sleep cycle. However, when I am awake, my productively doubles...quadruples even. Sometimes, people call me a smart ass.

In addition to a borderline obsession with optimizing systems and applications, I take great personal interest in experimenting with sound to alleviate aspects of the human condition we all experience. 

The potential I see in Calm as a long term reliable source for this type of service, is the ability to organize and translate widely scattered information into an enjoyable user experience. While I have not demoed the app, I do appreciate the content and usability of the website. I was pretty happy to see a Stephen Fry expert I haven't heard before, so thank you. This is exactly the type of material I like to incorporate into soundscapes. I believe once compression and subjective loudness issues are fully worked out and optimized, soundscapes with positive messages will enhance the life experience in many profound ways. As the scope of "mindfulness metadata" has yet to be fully realized, I would quite enjoy the opportunity to participate and assist in this endeavor where needed. the requirements of learning (internal tools) as well as advocating for users in distress, are core functions I incorporate in my daily life regardless, so I think position could be a good fit.

While I can't necessarily troubleshoot Mac/Windows/Chrome or mobile devices in my sleep, I spend most of my time typing away in colorful terminals attempting to get Linux Audio to behave as consistently stable as the aforementioned software layers. Having said that, I can debug most software with fair efficiency while 

I'm quite terrible debugging issues in my sleep. Despite my best efforts, different therapies, pills, fad diets, you name it...without fail my brain will paralyze me while it takes me through the array of bizarre scenerios we go through during sleep, designed to get us to realize or remember something. However, when I am awake, my productively doubles as I can actually read text in the waking life.

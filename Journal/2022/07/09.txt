lv2_jack_host

Kn0ck0ut-LV2 is an LV2 plugin to perform spectral subtraction.  It can be used 
to achieve a wide variety of effects, most notably removing or extracting the
center of a two channel audio file.  As Kn0ck0ut is only a plugin, you will
need a host for LV2 plugins in order to use it, such as Ardour, Qtractor, Ingen,
jalv, lv2_jack_host, or lv2file.

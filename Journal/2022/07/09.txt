lv2_jack_host

Kn0ck0ut-LV2 is an LV2 plugin to perform spectral subtraction.  It can be used 
to achieve a wide variety of effects, most notably removing or extracting the
center of a two channel audio file.  As Kn0ck0ut is only a plugin, you will
need a host for LV2 plugins in order to use it, such as Ardour, Qtractor, Ingen,
jalv, lv2_jack_host, or lv2file.

Save and restore the window layout
From version 4.8, and onward i3 can save and restore workspace layouts. To do this, the following packages are needed: perl-anyevent-i3 and perl-json-xs from the official repositories.

Note: This section only provides a quick tutorial on how to save the current window layout of a single workspace and how to restore it for later use. Refer to the official documentation for more details
Save the current window layout of a single workspace
To save the current window layout, follow these steps:

First, execute various commands to open windows in a preferred workspace and resize them if needed. Make sure to write down each executed command for each window.
Now, in a new workspace, open a terminal and run the following:
$ i3-save-tree --workspace N > ~/.config/i3/workspace_N.json
where N is the number of the preferred workspace. This will save the current layout of workspace N to the file ~/.config/i3/workspace_N.json.
The newly created file needs to be edited. This may be done automatically with the following command:
$ sed -i 's|^\(\s*\)// "|\1"|g; /^\s*\/\//d' ~/.config/i3/workspace_N.json
Restore the window layout of the workspace
There are two ways to restore the layout of the workspace: by writing a script, or by editing ~/.config/i3/config to automatically load the layout. In this section only the first case will be considered, refer to the official documentation for the second case.

To restore the saved layout in the previous section, write a file named load_layout.sh with the following contents:

The starting lines:
~/load_layout.sh
#!/bin/sh
i3-msg "workspace M; append_layout ~/.config/i3/workspace_N.json"
where M is the number of the workspace in which you would like to load the previously saved layout and N is the number of workspaces saved in the previous section.

And the commands used in the previous section to get the preferred windows, but enclosed in parentheses and with an ampersand appended before the last parentheses.
For example, if the saved layout contained three uxterm windows:

~/load_layout.sh
#!/bin/sh

# First we append the saved layout of workspace N to workspace M
i3-msg "workspace M; append_layout ~/.config/i3/workspace_N.json"

# And finally we fill the containers with the programs they had
(uxterm &)
(uxterm &)
(uxterm &)
Then set the file as executable. Finally, the layout of workspace N can be loaded onto to workspace M by running:

$ ~/load_layout.sh
Tip: Adding bindsym $mod+g exec ~/load_layout.sh to ~/.config/i3/config and restarting i3 will bind Mod+g to run the above script.
Note: If the above script does not work properly, refer to the official documentation. The swallows sections of ~/.config/i3/workspace_N.json needs to be manually edited.

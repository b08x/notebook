Therapy with psychedelics is an attempt to extract, express, //then// **work with** the root causes of our human condition. 

Mr. Doblin gives a concise insight as to why psychedelics have not been a consideration in the mainstream therapeutic process. He goes on to empathize the potential benefit of not having to rely on a medication that is designed to be a part of a person's permanent routine. In other words, there are more experiences ("results" being the outcome of potential) that tell us we can administrator a psychedelic maybe once or twice every few months (varies per person and condition) as opposed daily for the rest of a life. The latter leaving a lot of us depleted and stressed.

Neuroscientists can now use the imaging technology (mRI, etc) with certain psychedelics to learn more about brain functions that are otherwise inaccessible or inexplicable. (For example, How do you explain material objects maintaining shape every waking moment of your life? And the fact that we don't all agree or know at all, I believe, is a root source of most of our conflicts. Well, pyschedlics can't tell us how, but they can somehow, alter our brain chemistry to a degree in which we can more enjoy the fasnacting mysteries of life that )

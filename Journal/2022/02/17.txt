Hello!

I hope this message finds you doing well. 

I imagine you have stacks of applicants, each of whom will having compelling skill sets. My technical expertise along with my ability to gracefully liaise with clients is what I hope makes me a potentially more suitable candidate.

Several years ago my partner and I decided trade roles with her accepting a full-time position as an overnight Technical Support Specialist. In that time, while minding the household duties, I continued working on a project building a Linux distribution designed for musicians and audio engineers. While I've learned a great deal and have enjoyed the less intense schedule, I do miss the interaction with team-mates and clients alike. I'm mostly a night-owl, so positions like this are the ones I'm currently looking for.

Hopefully you feel compelled enough to reach out for a chat. If not, I hope you get a paper cut by the time you're finished reading this. 

Thank you || Bob

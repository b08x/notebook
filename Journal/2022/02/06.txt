Hello.

Aside from issueing this letter to cover my experience, I feel it neccessary to provide additional documentation to spite traditional eductional conceptions and expectations. That is to say, I'm adding an additional 45 words to hopefully counter balance the weight of a dipolma which I believe is roughly 35 grams. 

The challenge of marketing my qualfications without demostration is difficult one. I imagine you have tedious stacks templates, describing a lot of fine folk who can perform this job quite well. I think I can help and if we have a chance to have a conversation, you might too. 

My contact details are hopefully visable but if not; 614-653-8241 or rwpannick@gmail.com

I hope this communication finds you doing well. :)

Bob || Thank you

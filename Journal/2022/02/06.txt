Hello.

Aside from issueing this letter to cover my experience, I feel it neccessary to provide additional documentation to spite traditional eductional conceptions and expectations. That is to say, I'm adding an additional 45 words to hopefully counter balance the weight of a dipolma which I believe is roughly 35 grams. 

The challenge of convincing a person of qualfications without demostration is difficult one. Stacks of templates full of just fine people. 

My contact details are hopefully visable but if not; 614-653-8241 or rwpannick@gmail.com

I hope this communication finds you doing well. :)

Bob || Thank you
